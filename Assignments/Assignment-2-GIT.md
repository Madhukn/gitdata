# Perform GIT activities

* Create your own GITHUB account(if already an account exists, you can use the same)
* Create a new GITHUB Project (Maven based Java Project) - Code will be shared
* Define your branching strategy. You could just write how your code flow should happen in your README.md file. 
* Create other default branches (Develop, Release etc.).
* Setup the security settings to protect the default branches, so that no one can push the code directly to the default branches.
    - Make sure that even Administratory can not do direct push to default branches
    - Make sure that all conversation should be resolved before merging
    - Make sure that require minimum one approvals for merging.
* Setup your GIT local environment
* Clone the Remote Repository & perform code updates on index.jsp page and the updates should be available on the Remote Develop branch.
